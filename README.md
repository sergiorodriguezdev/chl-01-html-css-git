# Challenge 01 - HTML, CSS, and Git

## Project Description

The customer, a marketing agency, would like their website to be more accessible. They have provided me with their existing website code that I will refactor, and the end-product should meet certain criteria.

The HTML and CSS provided must be updated to accomplish this, but the website's layout and design **must not** change.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
